After completing all that, it's time to get to the fun stuff, data analytics!

In this repo, I have compiled all my previous notes (and projects too) for anyone to learn the concepts of data analytics/science!

You can learn them in any order, also, there's alot of resources out there so don't stuck with this one only!
