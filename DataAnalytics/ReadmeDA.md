After completing all that, now for the fun part!

This is for exploring data analysis and data science. 

I have included most of my projects and notes while doing them and you can follow them too!

Some resources I used are YouTube and FreeCodeCamp, (and paid Courses too) are included here!

But you can search for more and this is only for showing you the steps of it.

Data Science/Analytics is limitless, there is always something to learn!

#------Note : Most of the projects are ran using Python 3.8.10------
Packages you probably need:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. scikitlearn
4. matplotlib
5. Streamlit(creating your own webapp with your data inside)

Some files are in .HTML to give you the convenience of accessing it through a browser rather than a separate environment/IDE(e.g Anaconda/Jupyter)
