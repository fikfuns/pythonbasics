# pythonbasics
This repo is for the basics of Python, for me and for anyone whos reading it!

For anyone whos starting out in Python and interested in the field of Data Analytics or Data Science,

Here are my notes that I compiled during my self-studies and I hope it can be a help!

The order is,
1. Intro To Python(1 & 2)
2. Data Structures (This will teach you Lists,Tuples etc)
3. for,while if statements
4. Nested List Comprehensions (Very useful!)
5. Numpy
